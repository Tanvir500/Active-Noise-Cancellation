# Active-Noise-Cancellation

In this project, our objective is to reduce the noise. When we input any music or anything else, noise is easily mixed with it. Our project can lessen the noise from the audio file to a great extent. Here we have built a simple op-amp-based circuit. Our main theme was the superposition of two waves. By this, we just inverted noise with proper magnitude and shifting and almost reached our desired output by superimposing it with the main audio input file.
